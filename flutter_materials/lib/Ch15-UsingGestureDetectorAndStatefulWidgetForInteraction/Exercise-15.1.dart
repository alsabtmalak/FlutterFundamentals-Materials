/* Exercise 15.1.

Toggle Background Color with Text Feedback

  •	Objective: Expand the existing app to display a text message when the background color is toggled.
  
  •	Task: Add a Text widget inside the GestureDetector that changes based on the state of isButtonPressed.
   For example, if the background is red, display "Red Background", and if it's green, display "Green Background".
  
  •	Hints: Use a Text widget along with getColor() in the build method to show the message dynamically based on 
  the isButtonPressed state. */
