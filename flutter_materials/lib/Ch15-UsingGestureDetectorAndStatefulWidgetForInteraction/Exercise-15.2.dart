/* Exercise 15.2.

Implement Double Tap Gesture

  •	Objective: Add a double-tap gesture to change the background color to blue.
  
  •	Task: Modify the existing code to capture a double-tap event (onDoubleTap). 
  When the screen is double-tapped, change the background color to blue. Ensure 
  that tapping once still toggles between red and green, but double-tapping switches to blue.
  
  •	Hints: Use the GestureDetector widget's onDoubleTap property to handle double-tap
   gestures and update the color accordingly. */
