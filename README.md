  Open main.dart.
  Import the example file at the top.
  Insert the example widget into the runApp() method.

Exercise Files
  Exercise files are included for each chapter. They are empty files with instructions so you can practice solving problems directly in them.

Getting Started
  Clone the repository.
  Navigate to the chapter or example you want to try.
  For Dart examples, run the file directly.
  
  For Flutter examples:

    Import the desired example.
    Wrap it in runApp() and run the app.

Notes
