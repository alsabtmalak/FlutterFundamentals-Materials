/* Exercise 3.1.

Write a Dart program that asks for a student’s score (integer) and prints:
  •	“Excellent!” if the score is 90 or above.
  •	“Good job!” if the score is 80–89.
  •	“Fair effort” if the score is 70–79.
  •	“You passed” if the score is 60–69.
  •	“You need to work harder” if the score is below 60.

Additionally, if the score is above 100 or below 0, print “Invalid score.” */
