/* Exercise 4.2. 

Take two lists, and write a program that returns a new list that 
contains only the elements that are in common between both lists; example
  
  a = [1,2,3,4,5,10,20,45,78,90,97];
  b = [1,2,4,6,8,40,45,90,95];

Given the above 2 lists, your program needs to create a new list  having elements
in common between a & B and print c out
  
  c = [1, 2, 4, 45, 90] */
